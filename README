Usage: lujd identifier
       lujd [option]

Jump to the definition of a Janet identifier.

  -c, --conf-help            show config help
  -h, --help                 show this output

  --bash-completion          output bash-completion bits
  --fish-completion          output fish-completion bits
  --zsh-completion           output zsh-completion bits
  --raw-all                  show all identifiers

Look up the definition of `identifier`, a Janet
identifier, and if found, open an editor to
display the located definition [1].

Be careful to quote shortnames (e.g. *, ->, >, <-,
etc.) appropriately so the shell doesn't process them
in an undesired fashion.

[1] Lookups are performed via an index of the Janet
source code.  The index (a file named `TAGS.lujd`) is
built from a local copy of the Janet source code and
placed in the same directory.

`lujd` minimally expects the location of Janet source
code to be available via a file (`~/.lujd.janet` for
*nixes) and/or an environment variable.

See output of `lujd -c` for more details.
